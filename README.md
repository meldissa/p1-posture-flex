## Project Overview

Posture Flex is a site that focuses and aims to provide information and exercises to improve posture. This site has been created for my Portfolio Project 1.

## User Experience (UX)

## Strategy

### Project Goals

The main business goal for Posture Flex is to teach about good posture, why posture is important and to provide various exercises a user can learn and implement to improve their posture daily. The site users are interested in learning about benefits of good posture and performing exercises to help improve it. 

The target audience for the site would include users who are office workers/remote workers constantly working at a desk, or spend their day using technology and sitting down restricting their movement. Such posture and back issues are a common problem for those whose work doesn’t allow for much movement during the day. Users who find the lack of mobility, exhibit poor form, and will find that over time this results in a poor posture and back pain, therefore the site aims to capture this target audience and provide easy and simple solutions via exercises to help alleviate this issue. In addition, the site is accessible to all fitness levels and tries to account for this by offering beginner friendly exercises to improve posture which a user of any fitness level can complete.

## Design

### Colors

The palette was created using the [Coolors Website](https://www.coolors.co).

I have created a color palette with five main colors. The colors used are a mix of white, greys and two pastel color variants for pink and blue. I have picked this palette in mind of the target audience, keeping it minimal and simple so this does not distract the user from the main content of the site or overwhelm them with excessive use of different colors.

### Typography

The fonts were obtained from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).

For my logo text and heading I have used Lato. Lato is a sans serif typeface family, it is easy to read, and the strong structure provides a good base for the logo text and headings to capture the user’s attention.

For the main text I have selected Montserrat which complements Lato used for my headings and logo. 

I have avoided using overly stylised fonts, which can be difficult to read for users, therefore ensuring the website is more accessible to users with visual impairments.

In the event the font fails to load, I have used sans-serif as a back-up font.

### Imagery & Videos

Images are obtained from the [Freepik Website](https://www.freepik.com/).

I have used imagery appropriate to the website’s content to entice the user and provide visual examples in conjunction with the text for the different exercises.

I have also used videos obtaines from [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com).

The videos used within the project are to complement the imagery and text for the workouts section, so the user has additional visual examples to be able to follow the exercises with ease.

Please see further details in the __Credits__ section for the specific images and videos used within the project.
