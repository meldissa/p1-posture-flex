# Posture Flex

## Project Overview

Posture Flex is a site that aims to provide information about posture and exercises to improve it. This site has been created as part of my Portfolio Project 1 for Code Institute.

## Strategy

### Project Goals

The main business goal for Posture Flex is to teach about benefits of good posture, why posture is important and to provide various exercises a user can learn and implement to improve their posture daily. The site users are interested in learning about benefits of good posture and performing exercises to help improve it. 

The target audience for the site would include users who are office workers/remote workers constantly working at a desk, or spend their day using technology and sitting down restricting their movement. Such posture and back issues are a common problem for those whose work doesn’t allow for much movement during the day. Users who find the lack of mobility, exhibit poor form, and will find that over time this results in a poor posture and back pain, therefore the site aims to capture this target audience and provide easy and simple solutions via exercises to help alleviate this issue. In addition, the site is accessible to all fitness levels and tries to account for this by offering beginner friendly exercises to improve posture which a user of any fitness level can complete.

## Design

### Colors

The palette was created using the [Coolors Website](https://www.coolors.co).

[Original Posture Flex Color Palette](assets/images/posture-flex-color-palette.png).

The original color pallete created using the coolors website consisted of 5 colors, however for my final idea I only opted for 3 main colors to use for my website.

The colors used in hex form are white (#fff), dark grey (#202020), and blue (#52daf1). The white color was used as the main background for the website, the dark grey was used for the header and footer and the blue was used for links and buttons. I kept it minimal and simple so this does not distract the user from the main content of the site or overwhelm them with excessive use of different colors.

### Typography

The fonts were obtained from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).

For my logo text and heading I have used Lato. Lato is a sans serif typeface family, it is easy to read, and the strong structure provides a good base for the logo text and headings to capture the user’s attention.

For the main text I have selected Montserrat which complements Lato used for my headings and logo. 

I have avoided using overly stylised fonts, which can be difficult to read for users, therefore ensuring the website is more accessible to users with visual impairments.

In the event the font fails to load, I have used sans-serif as a back-up font.

### Imagery

Images are obtained from the [Freepik](https://www.freepik.com/) and [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) websites.

I have used imagery appropriate to the website’s content to entice the user and provide visual examples in conjunction with the text for the different exercises.

Please see further details in the __Credits__ section for the specific images used within the project.

## Skeleton

### Wireframes

Wireframes were created using [Balsamiq Wireframes](https://www.balsamiq.com/).

The wireframes have examples of desktop, tablet and mobile phone displays.

Originally, I wanted to create a website with 4 pages inlcuding Home, About Us, Exercises and Contact Us. However, for my final submission of the project I opted for a single paged website which consists of all these 4 pages split up into sections which can be accessed via the user scrolling down the page or selecting the section from the navigation bar.

## Features

### Current Features

* __Header__: In the header section I have included a fully responsive navigation which is accessible at different screen sizes. On larger screens for desktops, the navigation bar consists of the Posute Flex logo on the left hand side. The navigation buttons for Home, About Us, Exercises and Contact Us are locate on the right hand side. The user is able to hover over the logo and each of the navigation section buttons which has the hover CSS style applied to change color so user is aware that this can be selected. The logo can be clicked which will take user back to the top and each of the navigation buttons will take the user to the relevant section of the website. The navigation is also fixed, so when the user scrolls down the page, this is still accessible and the user does not need to scroll back up to the top to access this. There is also the scrollspy element implemented for the navigation so when the user scrolls down the page the relevant section is highligted to indicate to the user which section they are currently viewing. At smaller screen sizes the nagivation for each of the section is collapsed in a burger menu and can be accessed once the user selects the burger menu to display the drop down for each of the section which the user can select. The header section also includes the carousel layout which consists of 3 slides cycling through automatically, if the user does hover over the slide then this stops from moving forward. The slides also include buttons so the user can cycle through this on their own and at the bottom it display which slide is currently displayed out of 3 in the form of bars. The purpose of the carousel slider was to capture the user with the use of imagery and captions on each slider with a relevant link to take the user to the desired section. 

* __Home__: The Home section consists of content which provides the user an introduction of why posture matters, then proceeds to list the benefits of good posture and common posture mistakes. For the latter two sections I have used the Fontawesome icons and applied CSS style to add color to display the benefits in green and mistakes in red. This provides the user with further visual guidance on what these sections represent.

* __Exercises (Try These Exercises)__:

* __Contact Us (Get In Touch With Us)__:

* __Footer__:

### Future Features

Due to time constraints I was unable to apply additional features, in the future I would like to implement the following:

* A sign up to newsletter option, to allow the user to be able to get frequent updates.
* Improve upon the Exercises section, by seperating the exercises by posture concern. The user will then be able to select the relevant posture concern that they have and follow the set exercises making this more specialised. Add video to each exercise to allow the user the option to view this on how to complete the exercise.
* Add a blog section where the site will post up to date news, suggestions and tips in relation to posture.
